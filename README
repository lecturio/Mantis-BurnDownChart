VERSION
-------
This is version 0.1 - not fully tested and just an alpha version.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Ensure you have set the config "$g_roadmap_view_threshold" to something good (e.g. VIEWER).

INSTALL
-------
1. Place everything in a folder named "BurnDownChart" into the plugins folder

2. Apply the patch for manage_proj_ver_edit_page.php:
   ~/mantis $ patch < plugins/BurnDownChart/manage_proj_ver_edit_page.php.patch

   (It will add an event there to be able to add a start date)

3. Install the plugin in the admin section of MantisBT

4. Goto Manage Custom Fields and edit "Date resolved", "Initial" and "Remaining"
   - For each of these fields, link the projects to the field
   - DO NOT rename the field, it won't work otherwise.

5. Edit the project you like and add a version which will be your sprint.
   - Date order is the date when the sprint should be finished
   - Startdate is the start date of the sprint

6. For each task to add to the sprint, set the target version, the "story points" and the "hours remaining" appropriately.

Done.
